# FireEye HX Parser for Neo4j

This parser only works on Automatic Triage/Basic Triages.
This is written using Python 3.
You will need to install Neo4j and the Python library for Neo4j.


## To install the Python Neo4j Library:
pip3 install neo4j


## To install Neo4j on Ubuntu:
apt-get install python3-pip
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
sudo apt-get update

wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.com/neotechnology.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo 'deb https://debian.neo4j.com stable latest' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list
sudo apt-get update


sudo apt-get install neo4j=1:4.1.1
sudo service neo4j start




You will need to add your Neo4j username/password to the hx_parse.py script



This is still in development and has a few bugs. The parser will occassionally miss Network Events, I am not sure if this is a Python's XML parser or an issue with the XML itself.
